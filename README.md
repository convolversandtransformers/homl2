# Notes on Hands-On Machine Learning ... by Aurelion Geron
This repository contains notes, gists and code samples based on our learnings from the book [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/)

Our idea with this repository is to centralize our learning and make it an easy reference for many trying to solidfy their basics in machine learning.
We hope that it eases the learning curve and helps focus on the why's of applied ML.

## Reference
The book is an amazing resource in an of itself. Please use the [book]() for reference. 
For code examples followed in the book, you can setup the repository by following instructions [here](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2).
