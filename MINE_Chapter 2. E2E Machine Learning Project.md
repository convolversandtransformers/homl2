# Chapter 2. End-to-End Machine Learning Project

**Note:** The chapter is aimed at understanding the complete workflow in a machine learning project; a roadmap.

The **<u>main</u>** steps of machine learning projects are as follows:

1. Frame the problem and look at the big picture.
   2. Get the data
3. Explore the data to gain insights.
4. Prepare the data to expose underlying patterns to ML algorithms.
5. Explore multiple models and shortlist the best one.
6. Fine-tune your models and combine them (ensemble).
7. Present your solution.
8. Launch, monitor and maintain your system.
